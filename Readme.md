## Background 
In the present era, with the widespread pursuit of faster and more affordable space exploration, SpaceX has emerged as a leading contender. Demonstrating remarkable accomplishments, SpaceX has successfully launched projects like Starlink, a satellite-based internet system, and has sent astronauts into space. The key to SpaceX's extensive engagement lies in its ability to manufacture cost-effective rockets. On their website, SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches at a price of $62 million, while other providers charge upwards of $165 million per launch, primarily due to SpaceX's innovative first stage reusability.
